Development documentation and iteration tracking for Terminal Todo.

## Files

### `agent.xml`
Iterative development philosophy and execution approach. Defines principles for building horizontally, maintaining testability, and progressive enhancement.

### `brief.md`
Complete technical specification for the Terminal Todo application. Includes data models, UI layouts, command reference, and MVP checklist.

### `userFlows.xml`
Defines user flows and their acompanying tests at two levels of complexity: an initial implementation to put in place the fundamental logic of the user flow, followed by the comprehensive implementation of that user flow. This is not a sequential task list to work through, it is a reference point to work from.
