## Overview

**Goal**: Add multi-panel window management so users can view multiple roles simultaneously.

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Date Completed**: October 19, 2025

---

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Task 4.1: Window Layout Command (COMPLETE)

**Implementation**: `src/ttodo/commands/window_commands.py`, `src/ttodo/app.py`

Multi-panel window creation with role assignment:
- ✅ `window [1-8]` command syntax (e.g., `window 2`, `window 4`)
- ✅ Interactive role selection for each panel
- ✅ Sequential prompts showing available roles
- ✅ Press Enter to leave panel empty (optional)
- ✅ Layout calculation algorithm for 1-8 panel configurations
- ✅ Clean panel creation and mounting

**Layout Configurations Implemented**:
- 1 panel: Full screen
- 2 panels: Side by side (50/50)
- 3 panels: Left 50% + right 2 stacked (50% each)
- 4 panels: 2×2 grid
- 5 panels: Left 50% + right 3 stacked
- 6 panels: 2×3 grid
- 7 panels: Left 3 stacked + right 4 stacked
- 8 panels: Left 4 stacked + right 4 stacked (maximum)

**Code Quality**:
- `calculate_panel_layout()` function with specs for all 8 configurations
- `create_window_layout()` initiates interactive role selection
- `_show_window_role_prompt()` displays available roles
- `_handle_window_role_selection()` processes user input
- `_create_multi_panel_layout()` creates and mounts the grid

**User Experience**:
- Clear progress indicator: "Setting up window layout (1/2)"
- Lists all available roles with r1, r2 format
- Allows empty panels (press Enter to skip)
- Visual confirmation via displayed panels

### ✅ Task 4.2: Multi-Panel Rendering (COMPLETE)

**Implementation**: `src/ttodo/ui/multi_panel_grid.py`

Beautiful multi-panel grid rendering:
- ✅ `MultiPanelGrid` container widget with Textual layout
- ✅ `PanelContainer` wrapper for each role panel
- ✅ Dynamic layout composition based on panel count
- ✅ Horizontal/Vertical container nesting for complex layouts
- ✅ CSS styling for proper sizing and spacing
- ✅ Transparent backgrounds with autumnal border colors
- ✅ Rounded corners on input container border

**Visual Design**:
- Panels fill available space equally (1fr sizing)
- No gray backgrounds (transparent)
- Autumnal tan border color (#D4A574)
- Rounded borders for polished appearance
- Each panel displays role's tasks with full functionality

**Code Architecture**:
- `PanelContainer` manages individual panel state
- `MultiPanelGrid.compose()` yields layout based on panel_count
- CSS ensures responsive sizing across all configurations
- Panel refresh recreates panels to fetch fresh data

### ✅ Task 4.3: Panel Focus Management (COMPLETE)

**Implementation**: `src/ttodo/app.py`, `src/ttodo/ui/multi_panel_grid.py`

Tab cycling between panels with visual feedback:
- ✅ Tab key binding to switch focus
- ✅ `action_focus_next_panel()` handles Tab press
- ✅ Circular cycling (wraps from last to first)
- ✅ Visual focus indicator (brighter panel color)
- ✅ Active role updates automatically on focus change
- ✅ Role label in input border shows active role (e.g., "r1", "r2")

**Focus State Management**:
- `focused_panel_index` tracks current focus
- `focus_next_panel()` cycles focus with wraparound
- `set_focus(True/False)` updates panel brightness
- Active role ID syncs with focused panel
- Role label updates instantly on Tab

**Visual Feedback**:
- Focused panel: 120% brightness (via `is_active=True`)
- Unfocused panels: Normal brightness
- Input border title shows active role ("r1", "r2", etc.)
- Clean, obvious focus indication

**User Experience**:
- Tab switches focus instantly
- No lag or visual glitches
- Always clear which role is active
- All task commands target the active (focused) role

### ✅ Task 4.4: Close Window Command (COMPLETE)

**Implementation**: `src/ttodo/commands/window_commands.py`, `src/ttodo/app.py`

Panel closure with automatic layout recalculation:
- ✅ `close` command removes currently focused panel
- ✅ `remove_panel_from_layout()` updates database
- ✅ Automatic layout recalculation for remaining panels
- ✅ Returns to single-panel mode when all panels closed
- ✅ Clean widget removal and remounting

**Close Flow**:
1. User types `close`
2. Focused panel index identified
3. Panel removed from layout list
4. Database updated with new layout
5. Multi-panel grid recreated with remaining panels
6. Focus shifts to first remaining panel

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Closing last panel returns to welcome screen
- Cannot close in single-panel mode (shows error)
- Layout persists correctly after closure
- No memory leaks from removed panels

### ✅ Task 4.5: Layout Persistence (COMPLETE)

**Implementation**: `src/ttodo/commands/window_commands.py`

Database storage and retrieval of window layouts:
- ✅ `save_window_layout()` stores panel configuration
- ✅ `load_window_layout()` retrieves on startup
- ✅ `clear_window_layout()` removes saved layout
- ✅ Uses `window_layout` table (id=1 constraint)
- ✅ JSON serialization of panel roles array
- ✅ Automatic loading in `on_mount()`

**Database Integration**:
```sql
window_layout table:
- id INTEGER (always 1)
- panel_count INTEGER
- panel_roles TEXT (JSON array)
```

**Persistence Flow**:
- Save: Called after window creation completes
- Load: Called during app startup in `on_mount()`
- Update: Overwrites existing layout
- Clear: Removes layout when all panels closed

**Benefits**:
- Window layout restored on app restart
- Seamless user experience
- No manual "save" required
- Single source of truth in database

### ✅ Task 4.6: Enhanced UX Improvements (COMPLETE)

**Implementation**: Throughout `src/ttodo/app.py`

Polished user experience refinements:
- ✅ Role label in input border title (r1, r2, etc.)
- ✅ All success messages removed in multi-panel mode
- ✅ Interactive prompts use placeholder text (no layout interruption)
- ✅ Panel refresh targets specific role (not just focused panel)
- ✅ Transparent backgrounds throughout
- ✅ Autumnal colored borders with rounded corners
- ✅ Clean, uninterrupted workflow

**UX Philosophy**:
- Visual state IS the feedback
- No disruptive text messages
- Layout never gets replaced during operations
- Placeholder text provides guidance
- Immediate visual updates

**Placeholder Text Examples**:
- Delete: `Delete t1 'Task title'? Type 'yes' or 'no'`
- Edit title: `Edit t1 title (current: 'Old title') or Enter to skip...`
- Edit due date: `Edit due date (current: 2025-10-20) - today/tomorrow/'clear'/Enter to skip...`
- Add task title: `Enter task title...`
- Add due date: `Due date (today/tomorrow/DD MM YY or Enter to skip)...`

**Panel Refresh Logic**:
- `refresh_panel_for_role(role_id)` finds correct panel
- Recreates panel to fetch fresh database data
- Works across all operations (add, edit, delete, status change)
- Updates correct panel even if not focused

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Intentional Deferrals

**From Iteration 4 Tasks** (deferred to maintain focus):

1. **Panel Reordering**
   - Currently: Panel order fixed at creation
   - Future: Drag-and-drop or command-based reordering
   - Reason: Complex UX, not essential for MVP

2. **Panel Resizing**
   - Currently: Fixed layouts (50/50, etc.)
   - Future: User-adjustable panel sizes
   - Reason: Textual layout constraints, complex implementation

3. **Panel Role Reassignment**
   - Currently: Must close and recreate window to change roles
   - Future: Command to reassign role to existing panel
   - Reason: Simple workaround exists (recreate)

4. **Split/Merge Panel Commands**
   - Currently: Must recreate entire layout
   - Future: Split one panel into two, merge two into one
   - Reason: Edge feature, not essential

5. **Named Layouts**
   - Currently: Only one saved layout
   - Future: Save multiple named layouts
   - Reason: Most users need only one layout

### Technical Debt

**None significant**. All code is clean, tested, and maintainable.

**Minor items**:
- Could add keyboard shortcuts for panel navigation (arrows)
- Could add visual separator between panels
- Could add panel numbers in corners (p1, p2, etc.)
