# Iteration 5 Adjustment 1: Kanban & UX Improvements - COMPLETE

## Overview

**Adjustments Requested**:
1. Redesign kanban view with 3 separate panels, each with their own border and border label
2. Make window layout the default view - exiting kanban returns to window layout instead of single panel
3. Fix 3-panel and other multi-panel layouts not displaying all panels correctly
4. Allow switching between role kanban views by typing role numbers (e.g., `r2`) while in kanban
5. Add easy way to exit help message and return to previous view
6. Fix task creation in kanban view to use prompts without disrupting the view

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Date Completed**: October 21, 2025

## What Was Changed

### ✅ Adjustment 1: Three Separate Bordered Panels (COMPLETE)

**Previous Design**:
- Single Rich Panel containing all three columns in a row-by-row text layout
- Column headers rendered as text within one panel
- No individual borders per column
- Manual text positioning and alignment

**New Design**:
- Three separate `KanbanColumn` widgets, each with its own Rich Panel border
- Each column has its own centered border title (TODO / DOING / DONE)
- Columns arranged horizontally using Textual's `Horizontal` container
- Each column independently renders its own content

**Implementation Changes**:

**File: `src/ttodo/ui/kanban.py`** - Complete rewrite (344 lines → 133 lines, 61% reduction)

**Architecture**:
1. **`KanbanColumn(Static)`** - Individual column widget
   - Parameters: `column_name`, `status`, `role_id`, `color`
   - Renders its own Rich Panel with border and title
   - Filters and sorts tasks for its specific status (todo/doing/done)
   - Handles empty state per column

2. **`KanbanBoard(Horizontal)`** - Container for three columns
   - Extends Textual's `Horizontal` container
   - Composes three `KanbanColumn` widgets side by side
   - Provides `refresh_columns()` method to update all three columns
   - Stores role information for column creation

**Visual Result**:
```
┌────────── TODO ──────────┐  ┌────────── DOING ─────────┐  ┌────────── DONE ──────────┐
│ t1: Implement feature    │  │ t2: Review PR            │  │ t5: Fix bug              │
│   Due: Tomorrow          │  │   Due: Today             │  │   Due: Yesterday         │

│   SP: 5                  │  │   SP: 8                  │  │   SP: 3                  │
│                          │  │                          │  │                          │
│ t3: Write tests          │  │ t4: Update docs          │  │ t6: Deploy to prod       │
│   Due: Next Week         │  │   Due: Friday            │  │   Due: Last week         │
└──────────────────────────┘  └──────────────────────────┘  └──────────────────────────┘
```

**CSS Styling Added** (`src/ttodo/app.py`):
```css
.kanban-board {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background: transparent;
}

.kanban-column {
    width: 1fr;        /* Equal width distribution */
    height: 100%;
    margin: 0 1;       /* Spacing between columns */
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Each column has clear visual boundaries
- ✅ Column titles prominently displayed in borders
- ✅ Easier to distinguish between statuses at a glance
- ✅ Professional appearance consistent with window layouts
- ✅ Simpler code (61% reduction)

---

### ✅ Adjustment 2: Window Layout as Default View (COMPLETE)

**Previous Behavior**:
- `k` command: Enter kanban from any view
- `r` command: Exit kanban to single role panel

**New Behavior**:
- `k` command: Enter kanban from window layout (saves current layout)
- `r` command: Exit kanban to restored window layout

**Implementation Changes**:

**File: `src/ttodo/app.py`**

**State Management** (`__init__`):
```python
self._saved_window_layout = None  # Store window layout when entering kanban
```

**Enter Kanban** (`enter_kanban_view`):
```python
# Store current window layout if in multi-panel mode
if self.in_multi_panel_mode:
    self._saved_window_layout = {
        'panel_count': len(self.multi_panel_grid.panel_containers),
        'panel_roles': [pc.role_id for pc in self.multi_panel_grid.panel_containers]
    }
    # Remove multi-panel grid and create MainContent
    self.multi_panel_grid.remove()
    new_content = MainContent()
    self.main_content = new_content
    self.mount(new_content, before=0)

    self.multi_panel_grid = None
    self.in_multi_panel_mode = False

# Create and mount kanban board
kanban_board = KanbanBoard(...)
self.main_content.mount(kanban_board)
```

**Exit Kanban** (`exit_kanban_view`):
```python
# Remove kanban board
self.current_panel.remove()

# Restore saved window layout (priority order)
if self._saved_window_layout:
    # 1. Restore in-memory saved layout
    self._create_multi_panel_layout(panel_count, panel_roles)
else:
    layout = window_commands.load_window_layout()
    if layout:
        # 2. Load persisted layout from database
        self._create_multi_panel_layout(panel_count, panel_roles)
    else:
        # 3. Show welcome message
        self.main_content.update("Welcome...")
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Window layout preserved when using kanban
- ✅ Users return to configured workspace after kanban
- ✅ Kanban becomes temporary "full-screen" view
- ✅ Seamless workflow: window → kanban → window
- ✅ No need to recreate layouts

---

### ✅ Adjustment 3: Fixed All Multi-Panel Layouts (COMPLETE)

**Problem**: Panels were missing in 3-panel, 4-panel, and other layouts because nested containers were using `100%` width/height instead of fractional units.

**Root Cause**: When containers are nested, `100%` tries to take full parent size, pushing siblings out of view. Fractional units (`1fr`) tell the layout system to share space equally.

**Solution**: Updated CSS with hierarchical selectors

**File: `src/ttodo/ui/multi_panel_grid.py`**

**CSS Before**:
```css
MultiPanelGrid Horizontal {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}

MultiPanelGrid Vertical {
    width: 1fr;  /* Only this was changed */
    height: 100%;
}
```

**CSS After**:
```css
MultiPanelGrid > Horizontal {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}

MultiPanelGrid > Vertical {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}

MultiPanelGrid Vertical Horizontal {
    width: 100%;
    height: 1fr;  /* Share vertical space */
}

MultiPanelGrid Horizontal Vertical {
    width: 1fr;   /* Share horizontal space */
    height: 100%;
}
```

**Layout Logic**:
- **Top-level containers** (`>`): Use `100%` to fill entire grid
- **Horizontal inside Vertical**: Use `height: 1fr` to share vertical space (rows)
- **Vertical inside Horizontal**: Use `width: 1fr` to share horizontal space (columns)
- **PanelContainer**: Always `1fr` both dimensions

**Layouts Fixed**:
- ✅ 1-panel: Full screen
- ✅ 2-panel: Side by side (50/50)
- ✅ 3-panel: Left (50%) + right 2 stacked (50% each)
- ✅ 4-panel: 2x2 grid (4 panels visible)
- ✅ 5-panel: Left (50%) + right 3 stacked
- ✅ 6-panel: 2x3 grid (6 panels visible)
- ✅ 7-panel: Left 3 stacked + right 4 stacked
- ✅ 8-panel: Left 4 stacked + right 4 stacked

---

### ✅ Adjustment 4: Switch Roles in Kanban View (COMPLETE)

**Feature**: Type role numbers (e.g., `r2`, `r3`) while in kanban view to switch between different roles' kanban boards.

**Implementation**:

**File: `src/ttodo/app.py`**

**Updated `select_role()` method**:
```python
def select_role(self, display_number: int) -> None:
    # ... get role ...

    self.active_role_id = role["id"]
    self.update_command_placeholder()

    # If in kanban view, switch to this role's kanban
    if self._in_kanban_view:
        self._switch_kanban_role(role)
    # Only display in single-panel mode
    elif not self.in_multi_panel_mode:
        self.display_role_panel(role)
```

**New `_switch_kanban_role()` method**:
```python
def _switch_kanban_role(self, role) -> None:
    # Remove current kanban board
    self.current_panel.remove()

    # Create new kanban board for selected role
    kanban_board = KanbanBoard(
        role_id=role['id'],
        role_name=role['name'],
        display_number=role['display_number'],
        color=role['color']
    )

    # Update and mount
    self.current_panel = kanban_board
    self.main_content.mount(kanban_board)
```

**User Flow**:
1. User enters kanban with `k` (shows r1's kanban)
2. User types `r2` → switches to r2's kanban (stays in kanban mode)
3. User types `r3` → switches to r3's kanban
4. User types `r` → exits to window layout

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Quick navigation between roles' kanbans
- ✅ No need to exit and re-enter kanban
- ✅ Consistent with role switching in other views
- ✅ Maintains kanban view state

---

### ✅ Adjustment 5: Easy Exit from Help to Previous View (COMPLETE)

**Feature**: Press `r` from help view to return to the exact view you were in before (kanban, window layout, or single panel).

**Implementation**:

**File: `src/ttodo/app.py`**

**State Management** (`__init__`):
```python
self._in_help_view = False
self._pre_help_state = None  # Store state before showing help
```

**Updated `show_help()` method**:
```python
def show_help(self) -> None:
    # Save current state before showing help
    if not self._in_help_view:
        self._pre_help_state = {
            'in_kanban_view': self._in_kanban_view,
            'in_multi_panel_mode': self.in_multi_panel_mode,
            'active_role_id': self.active_role_id,
            'current_panel': self.current_panel,
            'multi_panel_grid': self.multi_panel_grid,
            'saved_window_layout': self._saved_window_layout
        }
        self._in_help_view = True

    # ... display help text ...
    # Added: "Press 'r' to return to previous view"
```

**Updated `r` command handler**:
```python
# Priority: Exit help view, then exit kanban view
if self._in_help_view:
    self.exit_help_view()
elif self._in_kanban_view:
    self.exit_kanban_view()
else:
    self.show_error("Already in default view...")
```

**New `exit_help_view()` method**:
```python
def exit_help_view(self) -> None:
    # Restore previous view based on saved state
    if state['in_kanban_view']:
        # Recreate kanban board
    elif state['in_multi_panel_mode']:
        # Recreate multi-panel layout
    else:
        # Display single role panel or welcome
```

**Restoration Logic**:
- **From Kanban**: Recreates kanban board for active role
- **From Multi-Panel**: Reloads window layout from database and recreates panels
- **From Single Panel**: Displays role panel for active role
- **No Active View**: Shows welcome message

**Updated Help Text**:
- Changed: `r - Return to previous view (from help or kanban)`
- Added footer: `Press 'r' to return to previous view`

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No workflow disruption when checking help
- ✅ Works from any view mode
- ✅ Single command (`r`) to exit help
- ✅ Restores exact state, not just similar view

---

### ✅ Adjustment 6: Task Creation Prompts in Kanban View (COMPLETE)

**Problem**: When adding a task in kanban view, the app was switching to a text view showing "Creating new task..." instructions, disrupting the kanban board.

**Solution**: Skip `update_content()` calls when in kanban view, using only input placeholder prompts (consistent with multi-panel mode).

**Implementation**:

**File: `src/ttodo/app.py`**

**Updated `create_new_task()` method**:
```python
def create_new_task(self) -> None:
    # ... validation ...

    self.command_input.placeholder = "Enter task title..."
    self._awaiting_task_title = True

    # Only update content in single-panel mode (not in multi-panel or kanban)
    if not self.in_multi_panel_mode and not self._in_kanban_view:
        self.update_content(
            "Creating new task...\n\nEnter task title in the command box below:"
        )
```

**Updated `_handle_task_title_input()` method**:
```python
def _handle_task_title_input(self, title: str) -> None:
    # ... process title ...

    self.command_input.placeholder = "Due date (today/tomorrow/DD MM YY or Enter to skip)..."

    # Only update content in single-panel mode (not in multi-panel or kanban)
    if not self.in_multi_panel_mode and not self._in_kanban_view:
        self.update_content(f"Task title: {title}\n\nEnter due date...")
```

**User Flow in Kanban**:
1. User types `add`
2. Placeholder changes to "Enter task title..."
3. **Kanban board stays visible** (no view switch)
4. User enters title
5. Placeholder changes to "Due date (today/tomorrow/DD MM YY or Enter to skip)..."
6. **Kanban board still visible**
7. User enters due date or presses Enter
8. Task created
9. Kanban refreshes automatically (via `refresh_panel_for_role()`)
10. New task appears in TODO column

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No disruptive view changes
- ✅ User can see kanban board while adding tasks
- ✅ Consistent with multi-panel mode behavior
- ✅ Kanban automatically refreshes to show new task
- ✅ Smooth, uninterrupted workflow

✅ Kanban refreshed automatically
✅ New task appeared in TODO column
✅ No view disruption throughout

> add
[Enter title]
[Press Enter to skip due date]
✅ Task created without due date
✅ Appeared at bottom of TODO column
```

### ✅ Edge Cases Tested

**Multiple View Transitions**:
- ✅ window 3 → k → r2 → r3 → r → k → help → r → r (all work)
- ✅ No memory leaks
- ✅ All state flags managed properly
- ✅ No orphaned widgets

**Layout Restoration**:
- ✅ Enter kanban from 1-panel → exit restores 1-panel
- ✅ Enter kanban from 8-panel → exit restores all 8 panels
- ✅ Enter kanban with no prior layout → exit shows welcome message
- ✅ Database fallback works when in-memory state is empty

**Task Operations in Kanban**:
- ✅ Add task → appears in TODO column immediately
- ✅ `t1 doing` → moves to DOING column
- ✅ `t1 done` → moves to DONE column
- ✅ `t1 edit` → updates visible in kanban
- ✅ `t1 delete` → removed from kanban
- ✅ `undo` → task reappears in correct column
- ✅ All operations refresh kanban correctly

**Command Compatibility**:
- ✅ All task commands work in kanban (add, view, edit, delete, doing, done, todo, undo)
- ✅ help works from all views
- ✅ `r` with no number exits help or kanban as appropriate
- ✅ `r[number]` switches roles in kanban, selects roles elsewhere
- ✅ Invalid commands show proper errors

**Empty States**:
- ✅ Empty TODO column shows "No tasks"
- ✅ Empty DOING column shows "No tasks"
- ✅ Empty DONE column shows "No tasks"
- ✅ All columns empty shows three "No tasks" messages
- ✅ Layout remains clean and professional

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

**1. Container Nesting and CSS**
- Top-level containers need `100%` to fill parent
- Nested containers need `1fr` to share space with siblings
- CSS selectors matter: `>` for direct children, space for descendants
- Hierarchy-aware styling prevents layout bugs

**2. State Preservation Strategies**
- In-memory state for temporary transitions (kanban, help)
- Database state for persistent defaults (window layouts)
- Having both provides seamless UX with failover
- Multiple fallback levels prevent broken states

**3. Widget Lifecycle Management**
- Always remove widgets before recreating
- Use proper widget tree: Container → Static → Rich content
- Leverage compose() for declarative assembly
- Clean references prevent memory leaks

**4. View Transition Patterns**
- Save state before showing temporary view
- Check flags before entering view (prevent double-entry)
- Restore state based on priority (memory > database > default)
- Clear flags after restoration

**5. Prompt-Based Input**
- Placeholder updates sufficient for multi-panel and kanban
- Avoid `update_content()` in non-disruptive modes
- Consistent pattern across view modes
- Less code, better UX

### UX Insights

**1. Visual Boundaries Matter**
- Borders help users mentally organize information
- Clear separation reduces cognitive load
- Consistency (window panels + kanban panels) feels polished
- Professional appearance builds trust

**2. Workspace Preservation**
- Users appreciate returning to configured state
- Temporary views shouldn't destroy permanent layouts
- Mental model: "I'm just looking differently for a moment"
- Reduces friction and cognitive overhead

**3. Context-Aware Commands**
- Same command (`r`) does right thing in context (exit help vs kanban)
- Role selection (`r2`) switches roles in current mode
- Consistent patterns with context-aware behavior
- Users learn once, use everywhere

**4. Non-Disruptive Workflows**
- Task creation should stay in current view
- Help should be quick reference, not modal dialog
- Transitions should be smooth and predictable
- Users should never lose their place

**5. Fallback Behavior**
- Always provide a valid state
- Multiple fallback levels reduce friction
- Clear error messages when fallback fails
- Never leave user in broken/empty state

## Documentation Updates Needed

**Help Text**:
- ✅ Updated `r` command description to "Return to previous view (from help or kanban)"
- ✅ Added footer "Press 'r' to return to previous view"
- ✅ Existing descriptions remain accurate

**README** (if exists):
- Should document three-panel kanban design
- Should explain window layout preservation
- Should describe role switching in kanban
- Should explain help view return behavior

**User Guide** (if exists):
- Kanban workflow: window → k → work → r → window
- Role switching: k → r2 → r3 → r1 → r
- Help anytime: help → r → back to work
- Task creation: add from any view

## Conclusion

**Iteration 5 Adjustment 1 is COMPLETE and SUCCESSFUL**. All six requested adjustments have been implemented, tested, and verified. The kanban view now features three distinct bordered panels for clearer visual organization, the window layout system ensures users return to their configured workspace, all multi-panel layouts display correctly, navigation has been enhanced with role switching and help return, and task creation workflows are non-disruptive.

**What Changed**:
1. ✅ Kanban redesigned with 3 separate bordered columns (61% code reduction)
2. ✅ Window layout becomes default - exiting kanban restores multi-panel view
3. ✅ Fixed all multi-panel layouts (1-8 panels) with proper CSS hierarchy
4. ✅ Added role switching in kanban view (r2, r3, etc.)
5. ✅ Added easy help exit to return to previous view (r)
6. ✅ Fixed task creation in kanban to use prompts without view disruption

**Code Quality**: Production-ready
- Cleaner architecture with widget separation
- Simpler, more maintainable code (61% reduction in kanban)
- Proper state management with fallbacks
- Robust CSS with hierarchical selectors
- Zero technical debt introduced

**User Experience**: Significantly Enhanced
