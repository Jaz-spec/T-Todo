# Iteration 1 Complete - Foundation

## Summary

✅ **All success criteria met!** The foundation for Terminal Todo is now in place with a working TUI application, database, and color system.

## What Was Built

### 1. Project Structure ✓
- Complete modular directory structure
- Separated concerns: database, UI, commands, utils
- Clean organization following the technical spec

### 2. Database Foundation ✓
- SQLite database with 6 tables:
  - `roles` - Role management with display numbers
  - `tasks` - Task storage with all properties
  - `task_dependencies` - Blocking relationships
  - `window_layout` - Layout persistence
  - `undo_stack` - Deletion undo capability
  - `archived_tasks` - Completed task archiving
- Proper foreign key constraints and CASCADE deletes
- Performance indexes on role_id, status, due_date
- Database connection manager with helper methods

### 3. Autumnal Color System ✓
- 8-color autumnal palette
- Brightness adjustment functions:
  - 100% - Base color
  - 120% - Active/focused state
  - 70% - Blocked task state
- Color utility functions for terminal display
- All colors tested and working

### 4. Basic TUI Shell ✓
- Textual-based terminal interface
- Command input box at bottom (full-width)
- Main content area for future panels
- Command parser foundation
- Clean, responsive layout
- Proper keyboard handling (Ctrl+C, Esc)

### 5. Testing Infrastructure ✓
- Automated test suite (test_foundation.py)
- Tests for database, colors, and parser
- All tests passing
- Makefile for easy development workflow

## Technology Verified

- ✅ **Textual 6.3.0** - Working perfectly for TUI
- ✅ **Rich 14.2.0** - Available for markdown rendering
- ✅ **python-dateutil 2.9.0** - Ready for date parsing
- ✅ **SQLite3** - Database working with all tables

## Testing Results

All foundation tests passing:
- ✅ Database creation and schema verification
- ✅ All 6 tables created correctly
- ✅ Color palette (8 colors)
- ✅ Brightness adjustments (70%, 100%, 120%)
- ✅ Command parser basic functionality

## How to Use

```bash
# First time setup
make install    # Install dependencies
make init       # Create database
make test       # Verify everything works

# Run the app
make run

# Inside the app
> help          # Show available commands
> hello         # Test command
> exit          # Quit (or Ctrl+C)
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Textual is solid** - Clean API, good documentation, responsive rendering
2. **Color system** - Hex colors work directly with Rich/Textual
3. **Database design** - Foreign key constraints and indexes set up from the start
4. **Modular structure** - Separation makes future iterations cleaner

## Technical Decisions

### Why Textual over Rich?
- Better keyboard handling out of the box
- Built-in reactive widgets
- Easier state management for complex UIs

### Why SQLite?
- No external dependencies
- Perfect for single-user desktop app
- Full SQL features with constraints
- Easy to inspect with sqlite3 CLI

### Why separate migrations.py?
- Can initialize database independently
- Easy to test schema without running full app
- Clear separation of concerns

## Notes for Next Iteration

### Iteration 2 Goals
- Implement role creation with interactive prompts
- Create single role panel widget with proper styling
- Add basic task creation (add command)
- Display tasks in role panel with sorting
- Implement date parsing and relative display

### Ready for Development
- ✅ Database schema supports all role/task operations
- ✅ Color system ready for panel styling
- ✅ Command parser ready to expand
- ✅ TUI framework proven and working

### Refactoring Opportunities
- None yet - keep it simple for now
- Will watch for patterns as we add commands

## Questions Addressed

**Q: Does the TUI framework feel right?**
A: Yes! Textual is working great - clean API, responsive, good keyboard handling.

**Q: Any concerns about Textual vs alternatives?**
A: None. Textual is perfect for this use case.

**Q: Is the foundation solid enough to build on?**
A: Absolutely. Database, colors, and TUI shell all working smoothly.

## Next Steps

Ready to proceed to **Iteration 2: Core Flow Implementation**
- Role creation and management
- Single panel display with role colors
- Basic task CRUD
- Date utilities
