## Overview

**Goal**: Add keyboard navigation mode for scrolling and window movement, plus complete role management features (remap, delete). This rounds out the core interaction patterns.

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Date Completed**: October 23, 2025

---

## What Was Built

### ✅ Task 6.1: Navigation Mode (COMPLETE)

**Implementation**: Dual-mode input system with seamless switching between command and navigation modes.

**Key Features**:
1. **Mode Switching**:
   - ESC (with empty input) → Enter navigation mode
   - Any letter key → Exit navigation mode, return to command mode
   - Mode indicator: "(nav)" displayed in command box placeholder

2. **Navigation Mode Behaviors**:
   - Arrow keys: Scroll focused panel (up/down/left/right)
   - Space + Arrow keys: Move panel positions (swap panels)
   - Tab: Cycle focus between panels (existing feature, works in both modes)

3. **Command Mode Behaviors**:
   - Arrow up/down: Navigate command history
   - All normal text input and commands

**Files Modified**:
- `src/ttodo/app.py`:
  - Added navigation mode state flags (`_in_navigation_mode`, `_space_pressed`)
  - Implemented `on_key()` handler for keyboard event processing
  - Added `_enter_navigation_mode()` and `_exit_navigation_mode()` methods
  - Implemented `_update_input_placeholder()` to show mode indicator
  - Added `_handle_navigation_key()` for routing arrow keys based on mode

**Code Highlights**:
```python
def on_key(self, event) -> None:
    """Handle key presses for navigation mode and command history."""
    # ESC with empty input → navigation mode
    # Any letter → command mode
    # Space tracked for panel movement
    # Arrow keys: history (cmd mode) or scroll/move (nav mode)
```

---

### ✅ Task 6.2: Panel Scrolling (COMPLETE)

**Implementation**: Arrow key scrolling for panels in navigation mode.

**Features**:
- Up/Down arrows: Scroll vertically through task lists
- Left/Right arrows: Scroll horizontally (for wide content)
- Works in both single-panel and multi-panel modes
- Each panel maintains independent scroll state

**Implementation**:
```python
def _scroll_panel(self, direction: str) -> bool:
    """Scroll the focused panel."""
    # Get focused panel (multi-panel or single)
    # Call scroll_relative(x/y) based on direction
```

**Scroll Integration**:
- Uses Textual's built-in `scroll_relative()` method
- Smooth scrolling with single-line increments
- Respects panel boundaries

---

### ✅ Task 6.3: Panel Movement (COMPLETE)

**Implementation**: Space + Arrow keys to swap panel positions in navigation mode.

**Features**:
- Space + Arrow keys: Move focused panel in specified direction
- Layout-aware movement (respects grid structure)
- Automatic database persistence of new layout
- Focus follows the moved panel

**Key Components**:

1. **Movement Logic** (`_move_panel()`):
   - Detects Space + Arrow key combination
   - Calculates target panel index based on layout
   - Swaps panels and updates database

2. **Layout Calculation** (`_calculate_target_panel_index()`):
   - Handles all 8 panel layouts (1-8 panels)
   - Respects layout structure:
     - 2 panels: Left-right swapping only
     - 3 panels: Left (50%) + right 2 stacked
     - 4 panels: 2x2 grid
     - 5-8 panels: Complex stacked layouts

3. **Panel Swapping** (`MultiPanelGrid.swap_panels()`):
   - Swaps role_ids between panels
   - Updates internal panel_roles list
   - Refreshes both panels to show new roles
   - Updates focus to follow moved panel

**Files Modified**:
- `src/ttodo/app.py`: Added `_move_panel()` and `_calculate_target_panel_index()`
- `src/ttodo/ui/multi_panel_grid.py`: Added `swap_panels()` method

**Example Movement Logic**:
```python
# 4-panel grid:  [0][1]
#                 [2][3]
# Up from [2] → [0], Down from [1] → [3]
# Left from [1] → [0], Right from [0] → [1]
```

---

### ✅ Task 6.4: Role Remap Command (COMPLETE)

**Implementation**: Interactive command to reassign role display numbers.

**Command**: `role remap`

**User Flow**:
1. User types `role remap`
2. System displays current role mapping:
   ```
   Current mapping:
     1: Work
     2: Personal
     3: Learning
   ```
3. User enters remapping (e.g., `Work:3`, `Personal:1`)
4. System validates and updates display
5. Empty input (Enter) → Save and finish

**Features**:
- **Interactive Multi-Step Process**: Enter mappings one at a time
- **Live Preview**: Shows updated mapping after each change
- **Validation**:
  - Role name must exist
  - New number must be valid integer
  - Prevents duplicate assignments
- **Database Persistence**: Two-phase update to avoid constraint violations
- **Auto-Refresh**: All panels update to show new numbers

**Implementation**:
```python
def start_role_remap(self) -> None:
    """Start the role remap process."""
    # Show current mapping
    # Set _awaiting_role_remap flag

def _handle_role_remap_input(self, input_str: str) -> None:
    """Process each remapping entry."""
    # Parse "role_name:new_number"
    # Validate and update temp list
    # Show updated preview

def _finish_role_remap(self) -> None:
    """Save remapping to database."""
    # Call remap_role_numbers()
    # Refresh all panels
```

**Database Update** (`role_commands.remap_role_numbers()`):
```python
# Two-phase update to avoid UNIQUE constraint issues:
# 1. Set all to negative values
# 2. Set all to positive values
# Uses transaction for atomicity
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/ttodo/app.py`: Added `start_role_remap()`, `_handle_role_remap_input()`, `_finish_role_remap()`
- `src/ttodo/commands/role_commands.py`: Added `remap_role_numbers()`

---

### ✅ Task 6.5: Role Delete Command (COMPLETE)

**Implementation**: Delete currently active role with validation and confirmation.

**Command**: `delete` (when a role is selected)

**User Flow**:
1. User selects a role (e.g., `r3`)
2. User types `delete`
3. System validates:
   - Role exists
   - Role has no tasks (prevents deletion if tasks exist)
4. System asks: "Delete role 'Work'? (yes/no)"
5. User confirms (`yes` or `no`)
6. If yes: Delete role, save to undo stack, refresh view

**Features**:
- **Validation**: Prevents deletion of roles with tasks
- **Confirmation Required**: Must type "yes" to confirm
- **Undo Support**: Saves role data to undo_stack
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Clears active role if deleted
- **View Refresh**: Updates all panels/views after deletion

**Implementation**:
```python
def start_delete_command(self) -> None:
    """Start the delete command (role)."""
    # Validate role has no tasks
    # Show confirmation prompt

def _handle_role_delete_confirmation(self, response: str) -> None:
    """Handle deletion confirmation."""
    # If "yes": Save to undo, delete, refresh
    # If "no": Cancel and restore view
```

**Undo Stack Integration**:
```python
# Save role data as JSON
role_data = {
    'type': 'role',
    'role_id': role['id'],
    'display_number': role['display_number'],
    'name': role['name'],
    'color': role['color']
}
db.execute("INSERT INTO undo_stack (action_type, data) VALUES (?, ?)",
           ('delete_role', json.dumps(role_data)))
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/ttodo/app.py`: Added `start_delete_command()`, `_handle_role_delete_confirmation()`
- `src/ttodo/commands/role_commands.py`: Added `role_has_tasks()` helper

---

### ✅ Task 6.6: Command History Navigation (COMPLETE)

**Implementation**: Up/down arrow keys to navigate command history in command mode.

**Features**:
- Up arrow: Navigate to previous command
- Down arrow: Navigate to next command
- End of history: Clear input
- Stores last 50 commands
- Duplicate commands not stored consecutively
- Works only in command mode (not in navigation mode)

**Implementation**:
- `CommandInput` class: Stores history and index
- `add_to_history()`: Adds command after successful execution
- `_command_history_up()` and `_command_history_down()`: Navigate history
- Integrated with `on_key()` handler

**Code**:
```python
class CommandInput(Input):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(...)
        self.command_history = []
        self.history_index = -1

    def add_to_history(self, command: str):
        """Add command to history (max 50)."""
        if command and command != self.command_history[-1]:
            self.command_history.append(command)
            if len(self.command_history) > 50:
                self.command_history.pop(0)
```

---

### ✅ Task 6.7: Undo for Role Deletions (COMPLETE)

**Implementation**: Extended undo system to support both task and role deletions.

**Features**:
- `undo` command works for both tasks and roles
- Checks last deletion type from undo_stack
- Restores role with original ID and display_number
- Refreshes all panels after restoration

**Updated Method**:
```python
def undo_last_deletion(self) -> None:
    """Undo the last deleted task or role."""
    # Get last deletion from undo_stack
    # Check action_type
    # If delete_task: Use existing task undo logic
    # If delete_role: Restore role to database
    # Refresh views
```

**Role Restoration**:
```python
# Restore role with original ID
db.execute("""INSERT INTO roles (id, display_number, name, color)
               VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)""",
           (role_id, display_number, name, color))
# Remove from undo stack
# Refresh all panels
```

## Post-Implementation Bug Fixes

**Date**: October 26, 2025

After initial implementation, three critical bugs were discovered and fixed:

### Bug Fix 1: Tab Key Not Cycling Between Windows

**Issue**: Pressing Tab key did not cycle focus between panels in multi-panel mode.

**Root Cause**: The Tab binding on TodoApp didn't have priority, so when CommandInput widget had focus, the binding wasn't being checked by Textual's event system.

**Diagnosis Process**:
1. Verified binding was properly configured: `Binding("tab", "focus_next_panel", ...)`
2. Confirmed `action_focus_next_panel()` method existed and had correct logic
3. Traced event flow: Widget `_on_key()` → App `on_key()` → Bindings
4. Discovered that without `priority=True`, app-level bindings don't fire when a focusable widget handles the key

**Fix**: Added `priority=True` parameter to Tab binding:
```python
# src/ttodo/app.py line 110
Binding("tab", "focus_next_panel", "Next Panel", show=False, priority=True),
```

**Result**: ✅ Tab key now cycles through panels correctly

---

### Bug Fix 2: Active Window Not Showing Color Change

**Issue**: When focus changed between panels, the border color didn't update to show which panel was active (120% brightness).

**Root Cause**: `PanelContainer.set_focus()` was updating the `is_active` flag on the RolePanel, but the panel wasn't being fully re-rendered to apply the new styling.

**Diagnosis Process**:
1. Verified `RolePanel.render()` correctly uses `get_active_color()` when `is_active=True`
2. Checked that `set_focus()` was updating `is_active` flag
3. Discovered `set_focus()` wasn't triggering a complete panel refresh
4. Confirmed `_create_panel()` properly regenerates panel with updated styling

**Fix**: Modified `set_focus()` to always recreate the panel:
```python
# src/ttodo/ui/multi_panel_grid.py lines 44-50
def set_focus(self, focused: bool):
    """Update focus state and refresh panel."""
    self.is_focused = focused
    if self.role_panel:
        self.role_panel.is_active = focused
    # Always recreate panel to update styling
    self._create_panel()
```

**Result**: ✅ Focused panel now displays with brightened border (120% brightness)

---

### Bug Fix 3: Input Box Border Title Not Reflecting Active Role

**Issue**: When Tab cycling between panels, the input box border title (showing "r2", "Focus: Role Name") didn't update to reflect the newly focused panel.

**Root Cause**: `action_focus_next_panel()` was calling `_update_input_placeholder()` (which updates the placeholder text) but not `update_command_placeholder()` (which updates the border title, subtitle, and border color).

**Diagnosis Process**:
1. Located `update_command_placeholder()` method that updates border title/subtitle
2. Checked `action_focus_next_panel()` - found it only called `_update_input_placeholder()`
3. Identified missing call to `update_command_placeholder()`

**Fix**: Added call to `update_command_placeholder()` in focus handler:
```python
# src/ttodo/app.py lines 1403-1413
def action_focus_next_panel(self) -> None:
    """Action handler for Tab key - focus next panel."""
    if self.in_multi_panel_mode and self.multi_panel_grid:
        new_index = self.multi_panel_grid.focus_next_panel()
        new_role_id = self.multi_panel_grid.get_focused_role_id()
        if new_role_id:
            self.active_role_id = new_role_id
            self._update_input_placeholder()
            self.update_command_placeholder()  # ← Added this line
```

**Result**: ✅ Input box border now shows:
- Border title: "r[number]"
- Border subtitle: "Focus: [Role Name]"
- Border color: Matches focused panel's brightened color

---

### Bug Fix Summary

**Files Modified**:
1. `src/ttodo/app.py` - 2 changes (binding priority, border title update)
2. `src/ttodo/ui/multi_panel_grid.py` - 1 change (panel refresh)

**Testing**: All fixes verified working in multi-panel mode with 2-8 panels

**Impact**: Critical - These bugs prevented the core Tab cycling feature from working at all
